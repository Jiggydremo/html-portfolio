<h1>The Best Movies According to Ebuka</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstella</h3>
<p>It was a very emotional film for me as the main lead wasnt there to watch his daughter grow up rather he sacrificed those moments for survival of humanity. Overall ill say its a 10/10 movie.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Another great work by christopher nolan, had me on the edge of my seat anytime they entered another person's dream and the subconscious started fighting  back. Overall a wonderful experience and a 9/10 movie.</p>
<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>Oh boy when i tell you that this movie was a masterpiece i mean it. The zeal Andrew Neiman had to become the best amd the determination to be at the top , with his instructor Terence Fletcher  equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods. Overall a 10/10 movie.</p>
